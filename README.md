Saves and restores publishing status in post revisions, replacing the default Revisions metabox with a modified metabox with pub status.

## Description ##

Sometimes it would be useful to track changes in publishing status throughout time, but native WP revisions will always inherit the parent's publishing status.

This plugin enables saving the post status ('published', 'draft', 'pending', etc) with each revision, so you can track publishing status where you have many users and accountability is desirable.

### Available Hooks ###

**`wp-revised-status_tracked-posttypes`**
You can use this to set up posttypes to track without using the options page. Your function should return an associative array.

E.g.: 

`
 add_filter( 'wp-revised-status_tracked-posttypes', function( $enabled ) {
 $enabled['post'] = 1;
 $enabled['page'] = 1;
 
 return $enabled;
 }
`

**`wp-revised-status_untracked-posttypes`**
Exactly the inverse of the previous hook. ** What you disable on this hook takes precedence to what you enable in the `tracked_posttypes` one.

E.g.:

`
function my_plugin_no_history( $disabled ) {
    $disabled['page'] = 1;
    
    return $disabled;
}
add_filter( 'wp-revised-status_untracked-posttypes', 'my_plugin_no_history' );
`

**`wp-status-revised_disable-options`**
If you are using the plugin inside a theme or another plugin, and want to disable the options page, you can just do:

`add_filter( 'wp-status-revised_disable-options', '__return_true' )`

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Where is published information saved? ###
An entry will be created on your post_meta for each revision, that will be deleted whenever a revision is deleted.

## Are custom post types supported? ##
Any post type properly registered is supported. You need to enable support for any post type either through the settings page or using the appropriate filters.

## Are custom post statuses supported? ##
Any custom post type registered should work... but let me know if it doesn't. :)

## Does this work with PHP < 5.3? ##
No, sorry. PHP5.3 at a minimum, but at least 5.4 is recommended.
